# vex-robot-project
Created for the design component of ENGR 120

This program enables a robot constructed of VEX components to continually scan a white page for printed black squares using an IR sensor.
A count is displayed with an installed panel of LED lights. After a black square is detected, the count updates and the LED lights reflect this.
A second, faster scan is implemented after the initial scan.
